**Q:** Is there a list of supported models?
-------------------------------------------

**A:** No, Haier have a huge list of models and different models for different regions. Sometimes the same model can have different names depending on country where it sold. Beside that usually people sending me message about problems with component not when it works. The only way to know if your model is supported is to try it out.

**Q:** I want to buy a new AC, how can I be sure your component will support the selected model?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** You can't until you try. The best way is to check user manual. Usually if AC is supporting ESP modules there will be information with which application native module works. So far all models that works with smartAir2, hOn and EVO application works with this component, sometimes you will need additional tuning.

**Q:** The component is not working, how can I troubleshoot it?
---------------------------------------------------------------
